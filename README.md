This project is a Lancaster University-inspired web application designed to improve the student experience through intelligent scheduling and personalized assistance. It features an interactive timetable that displays the user’s daily schedule in a clean and responsive interface. While the timetable in this demo is hardcoded, in a full implementation it would retrieve data from a database, ensuring that each student’s unique schedule is displayed accurately. The application addresses a common problem for university students — balancing academic workload, personal activities, and wellbeing. Most traditional planners are static and fail to adapt to a student’s changing needs or moods. To solve this, the project integrates an AI-powered chat bot accessible through a chat icon on the page. When clicked, the AI assistant engages in natural conversation, helping users organize their agenda, add or remove events, and stay motivated throughout the day. The AI uses sentiment analysis to interpret the student’s mood and automatically suggests complementary activities, such as breaks, study sessions, or relaxation events, that fit into their schedule without causing conflicts. By doing so, it promotes a more balanced and responsive academic routine. This intelligent layer makes planning feel more intuitive and personal, improving time management and wellbeing in the student journey. 

The project can be run locally by opening the terminal and typing “npm run dev,” then visiting localhost:3000.
